# anki-mode

Anki-mode is an Emacs mode for editing text files to import into
[Anki](http://ankisrs.net/), a powerful, intelligent system for
flashcards and learning.

Note this provides none of Anki's capabilities for spaced repetition
learning: use Anki for that. This is just a convenient way to edit
files with your own notes before importing them into Anki.

Improvements, contributions, and comments welcomed.
